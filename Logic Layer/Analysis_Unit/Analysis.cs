    /// It contains two main methods:
    /// - AnalyzeFunction: This method takes a function as input and analyzes its performance
    ///     Returns pairs of vectors representing different plots about the function.
    ///     Predicted time complexity, Space complexity.
    /// - CompareTwoFunctions: This method compares the performance of two functions.
    ///     Compares the avg runtime, array accesses, swaps for a fixed input, firing events on the process to track the state
    ///     Compares the runtime of both functions on same input for different input size
